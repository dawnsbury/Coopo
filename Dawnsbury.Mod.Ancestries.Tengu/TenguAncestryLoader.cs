// TODO: 
// * Make tengu feather fan, probably just a boring innate spell. At least try making it go off class DC? and make it extend to ancestry cantrips?
// * maybe make tengu weapon familiarity grant proficiency with the sword in your hand at the start of combat? proficiency with all swords is a little jank
// * i think the weapon names might not be actually working on the workshop upload, saw a screenshot where they were just numbers
// * level 9 feat: Soaring Form - You gain a fly speed. (maybe speed is reduced when flying over stuff?)
// * level 9 feat: wind god's fan - ugrades tengu feather fan, which i didnt make yet. gotta do that first
