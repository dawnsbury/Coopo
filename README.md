## Differences from RAW
* Each ancestry has a heritage which grants 2 free ability boosts (following the "Unusual" naming pattern as in the basegame, except for Tanuki who get "Completely Average.")
### Tanuki
* Tactical Retreat doesn't give you the fleeing condition, and instead just gives you the +10ft bonus to speed directly. 
* Ponpoko is a low-level adaption of Ponpoko-pon!, which scales like a breath weapon (e.g. Kobold Breath).
* Tanuki Tenacity is a homebrew 5th level feat which lets you spend an action to gain some temporary HP.
* False Priest Form doesn't require you to enter a form - you just get the benefits at all times. Instead of just being able to use Deception to recall knowledge of Religion, you gain equal proficiency ranks and can use your Deception modifier for any Religion check.
* Statue Form is now a reaction that grants you some physical resistance once per day, similar to the spell Hidebound.
### Kitsune
* Star Orb: Instead of giving you a familiar (which don't exist in Dawnsbury Days), the Star Orb is an item which allows you to use two familiar abilities from the tabletop game. The abilities are Orb Restoration (emulating Restorative Familiar) and Orb Focus (emulating Familiar Focus). These both take 1 action, as if commanding your familiar.
* Dark Fields Kitsune: The tabletop original gives you the benefits of Intimidating Glare but without giving you the feat; this mod just gives you the feat.
* Kitsune Spell Familiarity: Ghost Sound is not present in Dawnsbury Days, so there are only two spell choices. To change the prepared spell, use the retraining menu.
### Tengu
* Mountainkeeper Tengu: You can't choose the tradition of the spell; it's always a primal spell. (This serves little to no mechanical purpose in Dawnsbury Days.)
* Skyborn Tengu: Original fall damage effect doesn't make sense in Dawnsbury Days. Instead, gives a +1 to saves and improves successes to crits against air effects, as well as granting the Powerful Leap feat.
* Stormtossed Tengu: Doesn't grant the targetting benefit against creatures in rain or fog (no way to implement in-game.)
* Wavediver Tengu: Swim speed is equal to land speed, like other swimming creatures in Dawnsbury Days.
* One-Toed Hop: Removes mention of vertical Leaps (because the game is 2D), and explicitly mentions the Powerful Leap synergy in a Special section of the description
* Squawk!: Original cannot be used in combat, so it is completely replaced. Once per day, you can use a reaction when you fail a check to Demoralize to reroll the check and take the higher result.
* Tengu Weapon Familiarity: Just grants proficiency with all swords. 
* Uncanny Agility: Just grants the Feather Step feat instead of granting it's benefits on specific kinds of terrain. Doesn't grant Steady Balance because Balancing doesn't exist in Dawnsbury Days.
* Magpie Snatch: Completely different - allows you to grab as many items as can fit in your hands with 1 action.
* Soaring Flight: Functions like a Leap that can go over creatures. Also, can be made stronger by Powerful Leap.
* Brace trait: Reduced to a single action, and applies the damage bonus to any attacks made with a reaction Strike, because Ready doesn't exist in Dawnsbury Days.
### Battle Harbinger
* Battle Harbinger Dedication: Because archetypes are not implemented in Dawnsbury Days, the archetype is chosen as a doctrine. You also don't have to take the dedication instead of your 2nd level class feat - if you still want it, the new feat Harbinger's Resiliency has identical functionality to the dedication.
* Battle Font: Instead of the benefits of the battle font applying to all instances of bless and bane, you are granted special versions of the spells named "battle bless" and "battle bane" which use class DC and gain the benefits of battle harbinger feats. Only these versions can be prepared in the font slots, and normal versions of these aura spells are unchanged. (This is mostly for implementation reasons, and if you use these versions exclusively then there should be no mechanical difference.)
* Harbinger's Armament: This feat applies the effects of the rune to all melee Strikes instead of to a specific weapon, in the same way as the Dawnsbury version of Champion's blade ally. You also get no choice of rune - your weapon always acts as if it is disrupting.
